V The Digital Civil Society Lab at the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society Stanford PACS is pleased to announce the second year of their post doctoral fellowship program About the Digital Civil Society Lab The Digital Civil Society Lab envisions an independent civil society that thrives in the digital age through the safe ethical and effective use of private digital resources for public benefit The Lab is an initiative of the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society Stanford PACS The Lab is led by Lucy Bernholz senior research scholar at Stanford PACS and Rob Reich professor of Political Science and faculty co director of Stanford PACS The rapid adoption of digital tools for social and political action has resulted in a complicated new sphere we refer to as digital civil society Digital civil society encompasses all the ways we voluntarily use private resources for public benefit in the digital age We see evidence of digital civil society at the intersection of several domains nonprofits associations and philanthropy market solutions for social good political action and digital data and infrastructure These once distinct spheres now overlap in ways that require the adoption of a new framework rooted in the unique characteristics of digital resources and the distinctive values of civil society Digital tools and infrastructure allow individuals to associate network express themselves and mobilize others at lower cost larger scale and greater speed than ever before Access to digital infrastructure the creation of new digital tools and smart use of digital data as a resource expand and strengthen the ways we work together for good Civil society organizations are almost everywhere digitally dependent on third party providers for the digital tools and platforms they use The majority of digital tools and network infrastructure are built and maintained by commercial enterprises that are frequently surveilled by governments These dependencies challenge the democratic ideal of an independent civil society a space apart from the government and the commercial marketplace Most people cannot have private conversations digitally associational activity is more easily tracked than ever before and private spaces online are accessible only to the technologically skilled Corporations that provide the platforms on which people express themselves and associate with others are now implicated in protecting and enforcing free speech association privacy and safety Democratic governments and international declarations of human rights all seek to guarantee the rights of citizens to free expression association and privacy even when the precise interpretation of these ideals differ These basic rights inform our democratic systems and constitute core freedoms for all people Civil society s digital dependencies profoundly shift how these rights are experienced The lab s research draws from the humanities social sciences engineering computer science and the law to understand and advance the principles of civil society and democracies in the digital age About the fellowship We seek to appoint exceptional scholars who are actively engaged in research on topics related to priority research areas which include The key dimensions of digital infrastructure and data and how they influence the role of independent civil society in democracies Understanding creating and expanding access to software hardware and digital practices that align with the values of civil society in democracies The nature of digital data donations and or the governance mechanisms enterprise forms or legal constructs that such donations require The role of digital infrastructure data and connectivity and their influence on

Additionally, our tech shines a light on cyberbullying and self-harm ideation, making sure kids never have to feel alone or mired in hopelessness. Why would you not want to be a part of that?\u000a\u000a\u000aWe are currently at 80 employees, we are growing the company deliberately, with an eye towards maintaining a culture that values lifestyle, fun and continuous improvement.\u000a\u000a\u000aSecurly - \u000a30+ days ago
